# SnakeGame
Simple browser-based Snake game.

Project made as a team with 3 other colleagues, I focused on the networking (back-end) and game logic part.

In order to run the game, change the IP in the index.html (row 107) to your local IP. Afterwards, connect to ip:8080, choose a name and play! Move the snake using wasd.
